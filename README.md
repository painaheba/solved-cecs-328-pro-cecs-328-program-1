You are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence from various places <em>f </em>(1)=1 Equ 1     <em>f </em>(2)=1

<em>f </em>(<em>n</em>)=<em>f </em>(<em>n</em>−1)+<em>f </em>(<em>n</em>−2).

Let’s define a sum as <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>)=<em>f </em>(0)+<em>f </em>(1)+⋯+<em>f </em>(<em>n</em>). This assignment involves experimenting with various approaches to compute <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>), as well as, demonstrating various algebraic techniques for recursive definition.

<h1>Tasks for this assignment</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Write a program to calculate <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>) by calculating the values of the Fibonacci sequence recursively.</li>

 <li>Write a non-recursive program to calculate <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>). This second program uses the recurrence definition to calculate and TABULATE the values of the Fibonacci sequence. Then, sum these values to find <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>).</li>

 <li><em>Discrete &amp; Combinatorial Mathematics</em> by Ralph Grimaldi outlines a method to obtain the solution</li>

</ol>

<em>n g</em>.

Algebraically verify that <em>g </em>(<em>n</em>) is a solution of Equ 1 by substituting <em>g </em>(<em>n</em>) in Equ 1.

<ol start="4">

 <li>From task #3, there is now a third method to calculate <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>). Write a third iterative program by</li>

</ol>

<em>k </em>summing: <em>S</em>.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Use your preferred program to calculate these values of <em>S</em> for <em>n</em> = 10, 20, 30. Also, compute these values of <em>f</em> for <em>n</em> = 12, 22, 32.</li>

 <li>Task #7 suggests that <em>S</em>(<em>n</em>)=<em>f </em>(<em>n</em>+2)−1. Prove this identity (using induction).</li>

 <li>Finally, there is yet a fourth way to programmatically calculate <em>S </em>(<em>n</em>).</li>

 <li>Experiment with your programs to estimate the largest <em>n</em> that can be computed <u>successfully</u> by each program.</li>

 <li>Experiment &amp; run the recursive program for several sufficiently large values of <em>n</em>. Execute the other three programs with the same values of <em>n</em> &amp; compare the execution times of the 4 programs.</li>

 <li>Write your report and show a demo of your second program. The report should include a summary of your work, a summary &amp; conclusion of your experiments and the results of the experiments, as well as the algebraic work and a printout of your program. What are the advantages or shortcomings of each computation?</li>
